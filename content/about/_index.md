<!-- ### About Me -->

Hi, I'm fharook! 👋

I'm currently pursuing my M.Sc. in Artificial Intelligence at BTU Cottbus-Senftenberg in Germany (started Oct 2024), after finishing my B.Tech in Computer Science & Engineering from IIIT Dharwad, India.

Before moving to Germany, I spent over two years at IBM India as a Data Analyst in Hyderabad, where I worked on large-scale enterprise projects (like Ernst & Young), built automation pipelines that cut processing time by 90%, and even led a team of 10–15 analysts. I love turning messy, real-world data into something clean, fast, and useful.

Right now I’m having a lot of fun working on MotionCB — a research project at BTU where we use deep learning and satellite imagery to automatically detect and map solar farms across Germany. It feels good to work on something that directly supports renewable energy!

In the past I’ve built systems to detect fake news, harmful memes, and different types of humor in videos — basically anything that combines computer vision, NLP, and a bit of curiosity about how AI understands the world.

I’m passionate about clean code, thoughtful AI solutions, and I’m always learning (currently improving my German from A2 → who knows, maybe B2 by next year!).

Feel free to connect or say hi — I’m always up for chatting about AI, data, automation, or life in Cottbus!
